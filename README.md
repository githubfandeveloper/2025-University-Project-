## 🎯 Project Description
This project aims to design and implement a secure, scalable, and cost-effective hybrid network architecture for a First Aid Training Centre. It integrates both on-premises infrastructure and cloud services to ensure data security, compliance, and operational continuity.

We will design a secure hybrid network architecture using Cisco routers, switches and Ubiquiti Wi-Fi access points. Segment the network using VLANs to separate students, staff, guests, and warehouse operations. Implement security controls including firewalls and ACLs to protect the system from internal and external threats. Integrate cloud services for file sharing, email, and collaboration. At the end, we will test and validate the solution to ensure it meets the business needs of a First Aid Training Centre. To keep the project focused and achievable within time and resource constraints, the prototype will be limited to a single-site implementation only, with no inter-site connectivity. Will not include advanced automation, machine learning-based monitoring, or self-healing systems. 

This project was originally developed as part of my Bachelor of Information Technology (Cyber Security) at CQUniversity. It has been moved from the original university repository for portfolio display.
