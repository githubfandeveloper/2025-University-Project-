# Microsoft 365 Integration

With the integration of **Microsoft 365** into the `vitallskills.life` domain, staff members can now securely sign in using their **domain email accounts** (e.g., `name@vitallskills.life`). This provides a unified identity across all Microsoft services, ensuring a consistent login experience across Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive.

## 1. User Accounts and Access Management
- All staff accounts are created and managed in **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**, linked to the `vitallskills.life` domain.  
- New users are added through the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**, where appropriate licenses (Business Basic, Standard, or Premium) are assigned.  
- Centralized account policies include:
  - **Password management** (complexity rules, expiry, self-service reset).  
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to enhance security.  
  - **Conditional Access** rules to restrict sign-ins based on device compliance, location, or risk level.  

This ensures that staff and students only access the applications and services they require.

- **Teams** for collaboration, chat, and video conferencing.
